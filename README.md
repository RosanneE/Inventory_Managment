Inventory Managment Website (Laughing Stock Inventory Managment)
My app is called Laughing Stock Inventory Managment.  It allows businesses to manage stock/inventory.  It will allow users to create, update, delete and examine inventory items.  It will allow the user to create reminders to reorder inventory items when they reach a certain level. Later, I would like to include user authentication and tracking the rate of sales for items.
